    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Prepare this easy homemade lasagne ahead of time and save in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it during a
        busy
        week. Then just bake for an extra 45 mins.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbps olive oil.</li>
        <li>750g Lean Beef Mince</li>
        <li>90g Pack Prosciutto</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>200l Hot Beef Stock</li>
        <li>Pinch of Grated Nutmeg</li>
        <li>300g Pack Fresh Lasagne Sheets</li>
        <li>White Sauce</li>
        <li>125g Ball Mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches
            for about 10
            mins until browned all over.</li>
        <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated
            nutmeg, then
            season.</li>
        <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</li>
        <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack.
            Drizzle
            over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t
            see any pasta
            poking through.</li>
        <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
        <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.
        </li>
    </ol>
