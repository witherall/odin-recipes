    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Get everyone to help rolling meatballs and you'll soon have one supper on the table and another in the freezer
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 Pork Sausages</li>
        <li>1kg Beef Mince</li>
        <li>1 Finely Chopped Onion</li>
        <li>1/2 Bunch Parsley</li>
        <li>85g Parmesan</li>
        <li>100g Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Spaghetti (100g per person)</li>
        <li>Meatball Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, make the meatballs. Split the skins of the sausages and squeeze out the meat into a large mixing
            bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the mince, onion, parsley, parmesan, breadcrumbs, eggs and lots of seasoning. Get your hands in and mix
            together
            really well - the more you squeeze and mash the mince, the more tender the meatballs will be.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Roll the mince mixture into about 50 golf-ball-sized meatballs. Set
            aside any
            meatballs for freezing, allowing about five per portion, then spread the rest out in a large roasting tin -
            the
            meatballs will brown better if spaced out a bit.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with a little oil (about 1 tsp per portion), shake to coat, then roast for 20-30 mins until browned.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the garlic cloves and sizzle for 1
            min.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes, red wine, if using, caster sugar, parsley and seasoning. Simmer for 15-20 mins
            until
            slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Stir in a few basil leaves, if using, spoon out any portions for freezing, then add the cooked meatballs to
            the pan to
            keep warm while you cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling, salted water.</li>
        <li>Spoon the sauce and meatballs over spaghetti, or stir them all together and serve with extra parmesan and a
            few basil
            leaves, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
